Groceries
---------
form that allows a user to input items they need at the store
when the user submits the form, hide the form and display the list of items in alphabetical order, all uppercased.
Hint: To do this, build an array of the inputted items. (Make sure you don't include any blank fields.) Sort the array in alphabetical order. Make a new array with each entry uppercased (don't just uppercase them when you display them). Then, display the sorted list of things as list items inside a <ul>.

Word Puzzle -> semi finished, could implement part b
-----------
Create a website that uses a method to replace vowels in a string with the dash symbol "-" to create a word puzzle to solve. Hide the original string when you show the resulting word puzzle, so that another person can try and guess it.

Pig Latin
--------------------
takes a word turns into pig latin
could expand to taking string w/ multiple words and taking out white spaces, and splitting w/ arrays

Example:

roman numeral convertor

cryptosquare

String Input: "Believe you can and you're halfway there. Theodore Roosevelt"

Word Play
Create a form where users may enter a sentence.
Turn that sentence into an array using the split method.
Then, loop through this array to build a new array out of every word in the sentence that is 3 or more characters in length.
Finally, reverse the order of the new array, join it back together into a string, and display it to the user.

Build a Deck
Use a forEach() loop within another forEach() loop to build an array representing a deck of cards. A deck consists of 52 cards - 13 ranks in each of 4 suits.
Then, display a list of every card in the deck. (Hint: Each element of the array should read something like "ace of spades" or "4 of hearts").
The start of your output should look something like this:
